LayoutTransitioningImageView
============================

Sample Android app showing how to get ImageView and LayoutTransition play nicely

Nothing really special here. Most of the code is really just to get the app up and running. The only interesting part
is the `onSizeChanged()` method in LayoutTransitioningImageView.java which shows how to get an ImageView to transition nicely.

You can find more details [on my blog](http://buch.ghost.io/2014/10/26/layouttransition-and-imageview/).
